Hello!

I created a webpack configuration from scratch.
It's open source, of course.
The objective of this project was to help developers, either you're a beginner or not, to have a complete javascript ES6 architecture.
This configuration is here to help you to implement your JS architecture for your projects from scratch. No need to code the whole architecture, you can use it and adapt it to your projects.

To launch the project in local, you can use the following command: npm start.

If you have any remarks, feel free.

Enjoy!
